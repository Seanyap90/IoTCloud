<h1>IoT example applications with system and/or cloud infrastructure design</h1>

<p>Please send me an email at sean.sq.yap@gmail.com for the full codes for the simulated device, cloud functions and UI</p>

<h2>Embedded Display</h2>
<p>This is mainly a hardware based project involving arduino boards to build a display.  Future versions could include IoT functionalities and the usage of ESP32 boards</p>

<h2>Cloud based Real Time Monitoring</h2>
<p>Services used: IoT Core, Lambda, System Manager, API Gateway (Websockets)</p>
<p>Monitoring panel is a single page react app.</p>
<p>Simulated device consists of a raspberry pi and a python script</p>

<h2>Cloud based Remote Control Panel</h2>
<p>Services used: IoT Core, Lambda, DynamoDB, System Manager, API Gateway (Websockets)</p>
<p>Control panel is a single page react app.</p>
<p>Simulated device consists of a raspberry pi and a shell application</p>
