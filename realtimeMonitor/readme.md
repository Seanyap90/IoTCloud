<h2>Uses and Constraints</h2>

<h3>Use Cases</h3>

- User can know battery levels in real time
- User can know whether the battery is charging
- User can be alerted when there is a significant change, in this case, low levels of charge
- Service provides analytics for 24 hour trends of battery levels.  User can know the level of battery usage, the speed of charge and discharge, as well as the types of charging (regular charging, hot swap etc.) being used to charge the battery.

<h3>Assumptions and Constraints</h3>

- Assume battery is part of an iot device or a connected device with networking capabilities
- Assume device has consistent connection to network to transmit data
